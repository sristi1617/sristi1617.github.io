    <p>“People go on about places like Starbucks being unpersonal and all that, but what if that's what you want? I'd be lost if people like that got their way and there was nothing unpersonal in the world. I like to know that there are big places without windows where no one gives a shit. You need confidence to go into small places with regular customers... I'm happiest in the Virgin Megastore and Borders and Starbucks and Pizza Express, where no one gives a shit and no one knows who you are. My mum & dad are always going on about how soulless those places are, and I'm like Der. That's the point.”</p>

    <p>“SANDIA RETREAT---where earth and sky meet; where the OLD PUEBLOS rise again. The OLD WEST...the GREAT SOUTHWEST 'LIVES ON' in the Hearts and Lives of those of us who LIVED IT---and who LOVED IT---and who CHERISH ITS WONDERFUL MEMORIES from Our Childhoods LONG, LONG AGO.”</p>
